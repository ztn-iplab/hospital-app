    <h3 class="mb-3">🔐 Understanding Your Risk Score</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        The Risk Score reflects how much risk your login behavior presents to the system.
        It helps enforce Zero Trust security by adjusting authentication and access policies in real time.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">📊 How the Risk Score Is Calculated</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>❗ New Devices & IPs:</strong> Logging in from unfamiliar devices or IP addresses increases risk.
        </li>
        <li><strong>⏰ Odd Login Hours:</strong> Logging in during suspicious hours (e.g., 1–4 AM) may increase risk.
        </li>
        <li><strong>🌍 Low Trust Region:</strong> If your previous behavior or region had low trust, risk is increased.
        </li>
        <li><strong>🔁 Frequent Logins:</strong> Unusually frequent logins within a short time span may indicate a
            threat.</li>
        <li><strong>🛡️ Tenant-Specific Rules:</strong> Your organization may define additional risk policies.</li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong> Risk Scores are recalculated each time you log in, based on your device, location, time,
        and behavior.
        To stay safe, use trusted devices, log in at regular hours, and enable MFA.
