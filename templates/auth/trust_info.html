    <h3 class="mb-3">🔐 Understanding Your Trust Score</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        The Trust Score reflects the system's confidence in your identity and behavior during login.
        It helps protect sensitive data by enforcing security policies dynamically.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">🧮 How the Trust Score Is Calculated</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>✅ Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> Using TOTP or WebAuthn increases your trust.</li>
        <li><strong>📍 Known Device & IP:</strong> Logging in from familiar devices improves trust.</li>
        <li><strong>❌ Failed Logins:</strong> Multiple failed attempts lower your trust score.</li>
        <li><strong>🆕 New Devices:</strong> First-time logins from unrecognized environments reduce trust.</li>
        <li><strong>🔐 Custom Rules:</strong> Your organization may apply additional trust policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="mt-4">🔒 How Trust Score Affects Access</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>🩺 View Sensitive Records:</strong> Requires trust ≥ <code>0.7</code></li>
        <li><strong>⚠️ Medium Trust:</strong> You may be required to complete additional verification</li>
        <li><strong>🚫 Low Trust:</strong> Some actions may be blocked until trust is improved</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> You can improve your trust score by enabling MFA, using familiar devices, and avoiding
        suspicious login behavior.
